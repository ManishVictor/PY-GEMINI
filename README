								PY-GEMINI
								
As the program finds the similar sequences i.e. either homologous or core genes the program has been named PY-GEMINI.
(The program is useful for taxonomic analysis).For a taxon it will give you the homologous genes,core genes, recombinant
genes, non-recombinant genes and generate Newick files for the core genes and non-recombinant genes. Alongwith, all the 
above, it generates the files in a tabular form for all of the (core,recombinant,non-recombinant) genes in a manner where 
identical index/position of the genes in different tables represent core genes, non-recombinant genes  
 
The program has been tested only on linux like systems. Written in python3.

To be installed:
	Python3
	Python packages:
		1.Biopython
	To be installed in the path: 
		1.BLAST
		2.CLUSTALW
		3.FASTTREE
		4.PhiPack

	How to run the program:
		$python3 pygemini.py [path of input directory ]
		
		then the program will ask for the number of cores you want to use after informing you about the number of cores in your 			system.
	After the execution of the program the folder named 'FASTTREE' will be generated for both core and the non-recombinant genes that
	has the .nwk files (core.nwk,nReco.nwk).
